# FibonacciSpiralMatrix

Welcome to the README file! Usually nobody reads this (lol) but, I'm glad you're reading it. 

So, to run this app is pretty straightforward thanks to Docker. Please make sure you're at the root folder (FibonacciSpiralMatrix) and run

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

You'll be able to see the app running at:

http://localhost:3000/

It will request you to register, then login and last but definitely not least it will take you to the Dynamic Fibonacci Spiral Matrix page.

This app runs using:

ReactJS 18.2
Golang 1.20
Docker 24.0.6

Finally, the Sequence and Architecture Diagrams can be found at FibonacciSpiralMatrix/Diagrams 

Thank you for your time, crossing fingers! :)
